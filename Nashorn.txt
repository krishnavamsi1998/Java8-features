Nashorn: Nashorn is a JavaScript engine which is introduced in JDK 8.

With the help of Nashorn, we can execute JavaScript code at Java Virtual Machine. 

Nashorn is introduced in JDK 8 to replace existing JavaScript engine i.e. Rhino. Nashorn is far better than Rhino in term of performance. 

The uses of invoking dynamic feature, conversion of JavaScript code into the bytecode directly into the memory etc 

makes the Nashorn more famous in JDK 8. We can execute JavaScript code by using the command-line tool and by embedding the JavaScript code into Java source code.
