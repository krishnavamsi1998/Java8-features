This method exists mainly to support debugging, where you want to see the elements as they flow past a certain point in a pipelineâ€œ.

Let's consider this snippet from the same Javadoc page:

Stream.of("one", "two", "three", "four")
  .filter(e -> e.length() > 3)
  .peek(e -> System.out.println("Filtered value: " + e))
  .map(String::toUpperCase)
  .peek(e -> System.out.println("Mapped value: " + e))
  .collect(Collectors.toList());
