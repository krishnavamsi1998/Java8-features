What is a supplier in Java 8?
A supplier is a simple functional interface in Java 8 that does not take in any argument. It is used as an assignment target when making use of lambda expressions.

The following is an example that denotes the usage of a supplier:

import java.util.function.Supplier;
public class Java8SupplierExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Supplier<String> supplier= ()-> "HelloLearners";
System.out.println(supplier.get());
}
}


 What is a consumer in Java 8?
Just like a predicate, a consumer is a single argument functional interface present in Java 8. However, the consumer does not return any value and can be used for lambda expressions.

The following piece of example code denotes the usage of the consumer interface to print a string:

import java.util.function.Consumer;
public class Java8ConsumerExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Consumer<String> consumerString=s->System.out.println(s);
consumerString.accept("HelloWorld");
}
}
