 flatMap Stream operation is used for more complex Stream operation.

Here we have carried out flatMap operation on “List of List of type String”. We have given input names as list and then we have stored them in a Stream on which we have filtered out the names which start with ‘S’.

Finally, with the help of the forEach Terminal operation, we have printed each element.

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
 
public class flatMap {
    public static void main(String[] str) {
        List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; Names = Arrays.asList(Arrays.asList("Saket", "Trevor"), Arrays.asList("John", "Michael"),
                Arrays.asList("Shawn", "Franklin"), Arrays.asList("Johnty", "Sean"));
         
        /* Created a “List of List of type String” i.e. List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; 
           Stored names into the list
         */
 
        List&lt;String&gt; Start = Names.stream().flatMap(FirstName -&gt; FirstName.stream()).filter(s -&gt; s.startsWith("S"))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
         
        /* Converted it into Stream and filtered 
            out the names which start with 'S'
         */
         
        Start.forEach(System.out::println);
         
        /*
         Printed the Start using forEach operation
         */
    }
